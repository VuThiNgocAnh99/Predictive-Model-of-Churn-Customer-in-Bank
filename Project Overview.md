# Predictive-Model-of-Churn-Customer-in-Bank
The goal of this project is to find customer insights and build a model to predict churn customer at a bank. In this project, I have done 4 main tasks: 
- defining Churn Customer in bank, 
- cleaning the dataset, 
- exploring the dataset to find churn customers insights, 
- building and evaluating predictive model.
The raw dataset includes 100,000 observations and 50 attributions. 
This dataset is observed at 3 different time points:
- As of December 31, 2020: Observe transactions and customer behavior within the previous 1 week, 1 month before and 3 months before.
- March 2021: Observe customer behavior this whole month
- Juin 2021: Observe customer behavior this whole month
